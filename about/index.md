I am a scientist with a passion for **translational modeling and systems pharmacology**.  
My work spans infectious diseases, immuno-oncology, and therapeutic biologics.

I completed my Ph.D. in **Translational Biology, Medicine & Health** at *Virginia Tech*, where I developed mechanistic and hybrid models of host immune response.

Outside of research, I enjoy mentoring early-career modelers, writing, and exploring data visualization in pharmacology.
