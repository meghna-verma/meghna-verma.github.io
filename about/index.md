I am a Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) modeler with expertise in **infectious disease dynamics**, **HIV/HPV modeling**, and **pharmacometric workflows**.Â Â 

This site serves as both my professional portfolio and a personal blog.Â Â

## Background
Much of my scientific journey began during my **graduate school training** at Virginia Tech and Drexel University.Â Â 

From my **original website content**:Â Â 

> During graduate school, my research focused on developing **computational models of host immune responses** to infectious diseases such as *Clostridium difficile*, *Helicobacter pylori*, and HIV/HPV coinfections.Â Â 
>Â Â 
> I worked with **ODE models, agent-based models, and hybrid frameworks** to study pathogen persistence and treatment effects. I also designed **in silico clinical trials** for Crohnâ€™s disease virtual patients and applied **AI surrogate models** to accelerate QSP simulations.Â Â 
>Â Â 
> These experiences shaped my current focus on **quantitative pharmacology** and translational applications in drug development.Â Â
