I am a Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) modeler with experience in **infectious-disease dynamics**, **HIV/HPV modeling**, and **pharmacometric workflows**.  

This site doubles as my professional portfolio and a space for writing about modeling and science careers.

I work on mechanistic modelling, data integration, and building reproducible analysis workflows in translational research. For more details about my background and publications, see my [CV](/cv/) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meghna-verma/).
