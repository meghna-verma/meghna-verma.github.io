	<div class="blurb">
	<p>I'm a PhD Candidate at Virginia Tech. As a Graduate Research Assistant at <a href="http://nimml.org"> NIMMLab</a>, my responsibilities are not only limited to research but also science outreach and communication activities. 
	My research is focused in the area of <em> computational immunology </em> wherein I develop and write computer codes (in C++, R, MATLAB) to create mathematical interpretation of host immune responses in infectious and immune mediated diseases. 
	I am deeply involved with the design, execution and the process of data analysis of the output obtained from the computer simulations of the mathematical models. I utilize data science approaches integrated with different computational technologies and mathematical approaches that includes combining agent based models with differential equation based methods. I use statistical approaches and methods including variance based (meta model) and regression based sensitivity analysis to investigate the predictive novel insights obtained from the mathematical and computational models. 
	I also have have experience in utilizing machine learning algorithms to create <em> in silico </em> clinical trials, performing computational docking of protein ligand structures, and conducting RNASeq data analysis. Furthermore, I am passionate about science communication and also responsible for writing the press releases published on the <a href="http://nimml.org/news"> NIMML news page</a>.
