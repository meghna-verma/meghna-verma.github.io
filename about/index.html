	<div class="blurb">
	<p>I'm a PhD Candidate at Virginia Tech. As Graduate Research Assistant at <a href="http://nimml.org"> NIMMLab </a>.
	My research is focused in the area of <em> computational immunology </em> wherein I develop and writing computer code to create mathematical interpretation of host immune responses. 
	I am deeply involved with the design, execution and the process of data analysis of the output obtained from the computer simulations of the mathematical models. I utilize data science approaches integrated with different computational technologies and mathematical approaches, which includes combining agent based models with differential equation based methods. I use statistical approaches and methods including variance based (meta model) and regression based sensitivity analysis to investigate the predictive novel insights from the mathematical and computational model. 
	I also perform computational docking of protein ligand structures. Further, I am passionate about science communication and also responsible for writing the press releases published on the <a href="http://nimml.org/news"> NIMML news page</a>.
