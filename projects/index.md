### ðŸ§¬ EVUSHELD â€” Viral Dynamics & EUA Approval
- Modeled SARS-CoV-2 & variants to justify *EVUSHELD* dosing.Â Â 
- Supported FDA **Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)** with modeling reports.Â Â 

### ðŸ”— T-cell Engager (TCE) Modeling
- Built **QSP trimer formation models** for oncology & autoimmune programs.Â Â 
- Informed IND filing of *AZD0486*.Â Â 

### ðŸ§ª Cytokine Release Modeling
- Created models predicting cytokine release risk in CAR-T & TCE therapies.Â Â 
- Recognized with **AZ Global Head AI Award**.Â Â 

### ðŸ§« Infectious Disease Mechanistic Models
- ODE + agent-based models for *C. difficile* and *H. pylori*.Â Â 
- HIV/HPV coinfection modeling for persistence & treatment insights.Â Â 

### ðŸ§® AI-Enhanced QSP
