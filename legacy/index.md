I'm a PhD Candidate at Virginia Tech. As a Graduate Research Assistant atÂ NIMMLab, my responsibilities are not only limited to research but also science outreach and communication activities. My research is focused in the area ofÂ computational immunologyÂ wherein I develop and write computer codes (in C++, R, MATLAB) to create mathematical interpretation of host immune responses in infectious and immune mediated diseases. I am deeply involved with the design, execution and the process of data analysis of the output obtained from the computer simulations of the mathematical models. I utilize data science approaches integrated with different computational technologies and mathematical approaches that includes combining agent based models with differential equation based methods. I use statistical approaches and methods including variance based (meta model) and regression based sensitivity analysis to investigate the predictive novel insights obtained from the mathematical and computational models. I also have have experience in utilizing machine learning algorithms to createÂ in silicoÂ clinical trials, performing computational docking of protein ligand structures, and conducting RNASeq data analysis. Furthermore, I am passionate about science communication and also responsible for writing the press releases published on theÂ NIMML news page.
